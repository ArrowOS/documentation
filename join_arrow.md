## Requirements for the Official Device Maintainership Applicant:

-   Applicant should be having a good knowledge over the use of GitHub and Gerrit.
-   A proper commit history with authorship should be maintained for all of the commits being done or cherry-picked.
    
    > We have zero tolerance towards  [‘KANG’](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Kang)  and one found guilty will be removed immediately.
    
-   It is highly desired that the applicant should have a Telegram Account to be in touch with the team.

## Device Requirements:

-   We prefer SeLinux to be enforcing, but this is something we will evaluate based on the device and the applicant.
-   All of the Device sources must be Open Sourced. No private source shall be encouraged!
-   All the main device functions i.e, [Camera,Data, Voice Calling,WiFi, Hotspot, Bluetooth (and Fingerprint, NFC, Sensors etc if applicable)] should all be working to be fit for the use as a daily driver.
-   Device sources should be maintained to not have any errors during upstream updates & changes for the proper functioning of automated Jenkins builds.

### You can apply for the maintainership by mailing us at  [arrowos.contact@gmail.com](mailto:arrowos.contact@gmail.com)

#### Be sure to include:

-   Your name.

### Benefits

The maintainers will now be given few privileges, handing them full control over to Jenkins to initiate a test build anytime so that there will be more preliminary checks done before the official releases.

We are also looking forward in seeing more active contributors, which will open the opportunity for them to become a part of Core Team. Our doors are now wide open for all contributors. The criteria to get into ArrowOS Squad will be judged upon how useful and error-free those contributions are to the project keeping in mind maintaining code integrity and ownerships to those commits respectively.

### Procedure after being selected to be a part of ArrowOS Team

-   Follow the instruction and agree to the Terms and Conditions mentioned in the mail
-   Make a commit and add your device in  [arrow.devices](https://github.com/ArrowOS/android_vendor_arrow/blob/arrow-9.x/arrow.devices)
    
    > codename buildtype for example: z2_plus userdebug
    
-   Make a commit to add your name and your device’s name in the  [team page of the website](https://github.com/ArrowOS/web)
